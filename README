INPUT:
	age: between 0-100 [Myr]
	distance: distance of the center of the cluster in [pc]
	AV: AV in the line-of-sight of the observer and stars in FOV
	fov: Field-of-view in arcsec
	sim: location of the NBODY6 simulation folder

Running sequence:
	$ python gaiaBC.py age=2.0 distance=500 AV=0.0 fov=20 sim='/Users/Zeinab/Desktop/nbody6-zeinab/zeinab-sims/M103/Q05/Rh05/D20S00bin00M103r05Q05/'

OUTPUT:
	ID star: name of the star in NBODY6 simulations
        RA, Dec [arcsec]: position of the stars in arcsec from the center of the cluster
        Parallax [mas]: 1000/distance of the star [pc]
	Proper motion in RA and Dec [mas/yr]: proper motion of the stars in RA and Dec in [mas/yr]
	G mag: Gaia magnitude in broadband G filter
	(BP - RP): Reddening in Gaia Red and Blue filters
	Stellar parametrs: mass [solar-mass], Effective Temperature [K], luminosity (logL/Lsun)
        OBSflag: If the star is observable by Gaia or not ('T': observable, 'F': not observable) the criteria is sensitive to the stars separation and flux ratios, taken from Brandeker & Cataldi 2018 (Table 1), and also if the star is not fainter than 20.7 G-magnitude
